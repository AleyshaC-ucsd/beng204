## Datasets
Bulk RNA-seq analysis focused on the following datasets:<br/>
* **Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) & St. Judeâ€™s Cloud Platform (SJC)** <br/>
Patients: 3 datasets ; 161 pediatric (under age 21) and 987 adult samples; primary, recurrent, and secondary LGG and HGG<br/>
* **Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE)** <br/>
Cell lines: 69 cell lines, RMA-normalized mRNA expression data (ENTREZG v15 CDF), sourced from Affymetrix U133+2 arrays<br/>
<br/>
Single-cell RNA-seq analysis focused on the following datasets:<br/>
* **Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) hosted by The National Center for Biotechnology Information website** <br/>
SC from patients: 21 peds samples (5 HGG, 13 LGG, 3 Normal); 8 adult samples from 4 patients (HGG and Normal for each)<br/>
SC from cell lines: 8 total samples (6 HGG - LGG85, LGG349, BT138, BT237, BT54, BT88; 2 LGG - LGG275, LGG336)<br/>
